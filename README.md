Dynamic flow analysis of transformation of urban form to decrease car dependency. 
This dMFA explores the evolution of residential building stock differentiating between low-density single-family houses and higher-density multi-family buildings according to densification scenarios in 10 municipality types in Sweden from 2021 to 2100. The model links the building and car MFAs. Changes in residential urban density (inhabitants/m2) generate changes in car ownership and distance travelled by person by car.
